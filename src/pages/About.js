        Mint and Magic Shoppe formed out of the depths of a lightless place
        amidst a global pandemic when all found it difficult to strive against
        ones own circumstances. What started as a spark of creativity turned
        into something more; it bought light back into a dark palce. With the
        help of others, I realized that to live with abundance one needs to feel
        a sense of purpose and, for me, a small ounce of control in an
        unpredictable world. With candles, I could bring to those in their own
        dark places.

        The name, Mint and Magic calls on mint to evoke the cleansing and
        calming effects of it's namesake and magic to fill the depths of one's
        soul with universal hope and healing.
